I'm a Master's student in electrical engineering at Boston University where
I work in a lab studying the physics of the near-Earth space environment. Prior
to this, I graduated from Boston Conservatory with an undergraduate degree in
music composition and worked as a composer for video games, most notably
[Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/). I've also interned at
Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, where I focused on modeling
electron transport in liquid argon time projection chambers with unusual anode
geometries.

Most of my free time is spent thinking about physics, engineering, and computer
graphics. I have many notes on topics within these fields with perspectives I wish
had been shared with me while I was learning. While this blog is primarily for
me to organize my thoughts, hopefully it can be of some use to you.

Feel free to drop me a line anytime at zbeever (at) bu (dot) edu.
